# Online Voting System - Front-end

## Instructions to setup the project and run it

### Step 1

Clone this repository to your local system and `cd` into it

    > git clone "https://github.com/dextro-gear/ovsfrontend.git"
    > cd ovsfrontend

### Step 2

**Note:** All dependencies (Router, Bootstrap, Axios, Redux, Thunk etc.) have already been added to the dependencies so you don't need to install them seperately. They will be installed automatically with a single command.

Install the dependencies need to run the project using `npm install`.

    > npm install

### Step 3

Wait for the installation to finish and run the project.

    > npm start

#### Notes

1. In case any modules have to be installed in the future, use the `--save` flag to add it as a dependency so that other developers can use it.

   > `npm install --save package_name`

2. Follow naming conventions always.

3. You can use Emmet or similar extensions to simplify your work.

4. You may use any Bootstrap style you wish, but try to be consistent.

5. Do not add any build tools as a dependency.
